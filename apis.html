        <!--Interfaces allow users to control the way an object 
        or site works; graphical user interface is what helps user 
        to operate a laptop, tablet, or cell phone; user inteacts with the
        buttons and that's how the user operates the technology.Ways to 
        communicate with an object-->
        <!--API gives developer access to data; Represational State 
            Transfer (REST): Remote API; The browser is a web client connecting to
            a web server; you put a universal resource locator or univeral resource indicator
            in the search bar : http (hypertext transfer protocol); a 
            protocol defines the expectations of how to communicate; it 
            uses the 'get' verb to clarify that the request will only receive 
            data, not make changes; server receives the clients request and generates the
            web page sending back a response to the client; the body contains the HTML
            the browser then renders the page; HTTP is a stateless protocol; once
            the request receives a response, it's all done; if your client wants to
            manage that state, it needs to send it up with new 
            requests; 'post' means you are posting data to the server
            Headers: key and value pairs; used to help communicate what 
            is wanted; allows gor caching; status code lets you know what happened
            on server side; REST: APIs that meet REST's architectural
            constraints are considered to be restful -->
            <!--Client-Server Architecture and Statelessness: Program makes a 
            request to a erver using HTTP; It is stateless which means the 
            server won't remember anything about the particular client; to maintain state 
            (like loggin 
            details) you must send it with each and every request and you 
            do this using headers.
            Resource collections: CRUD; JSON nests data; every program has a
            way to turn a JSON string into a native object; get, put, post, patch,
            delete stae the intention of your request

                Libraries; Then is the method for promises
                
                CRUD    ==> VERBS(Methods/Operations)
                Create      Post submit data to be processed to a specified resource; takes an action and attribute
                Read        Get retrieve data from a specified resource
                Update      Put updates a specified resource
                Delete      Delete deletes a specified resource on the server
                
                Head: same as get, but it doesn't return a body
                Options: returns the supported HTTP methods
                Patch: updates partial resources
                
            Request: Header, Operation, Endpoint, 
            Parameters/Body
            From the server, you receive a respone: 
            usually in JSON data 


            API: contract by one piece of software to 
            another piece of software; 
            one piece of software says give me this information 
            formatted in this way and I'll give you this data or 
            function or response  
            
            REST: Representational State Transfer; Architecture 
            Style for designing networked applications; relies on a 
            stateless, client-server protocol, almost always 
            HTTP; Treats server objects as resources that 
            can be created or destroyed; can be used by 
            virtually any programming language

            It's restful if it conforms to the REST 
            constraints
            
            AJAX: Web Development Technique; The use of the XML HTTP request object to 
            communicate with service; sends and receives information
            in various formats; JSON, XML, HTML, or text files; XML 
            has been mostly replaced by JSON
